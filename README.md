# Design a website to meet client requirements


## Intended Audience

The intended audience for the Camp China website is, young adults in the age range of 18 year olds to 25 year olds mainly, this is because, this age range is more likely to go abroad and work, this experience will be valuable to them, because they will gather a lot of experience and skills whilst earning money and enjoying the beautiful culture of that country. The website will need to be user-friendly, by having a responsive design with a mobile optimised website, this is because, this generation is mostly on smartphones, and having a mobile optimised design can increase traffic. The website will need a ton of information, about the trip, because for most of the people that are going abroad, this will be the first time going alone, and they will want as much information as they can possibily get, this will include things, like insurance, vaccinations, salary, where they're staying, the food they're going to be eating and they job they're going to doing, what happens incase of emergencies, this is all vital information for people flying by themselves for the first time as it can be a scary experience. Furthurmore, you don't need much experience to join a camp.
